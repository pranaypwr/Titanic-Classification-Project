# Titanic-Classification-Project
Project Title: Titanic Survival Prediction
Project Overview:
In this project, we will build a binary classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not. The dataset includes information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and other relevant features. The aim is to employ data science techniques in Python to create a predictive model that can classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.

Project Steps:
# Data Collection:
Obtain the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers.
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.

# Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, if any, by imputing or removing them.
Encode categorical variables and transform any necessary features.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize relationships between different features and survival rates.
Gain insights into the dataset to inform feature selection and engineering.

# Feature Engineering:
Create new features that might enhance the model's predictive power.
Select relevant features based on EDA and domain knowledge.

# Model Building:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Choose and implement classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests).
Train the model on the training set.

# Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
Adjust hyperparameters if necessary to improve performance.

# Prediction and Interpretation:
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
Interpret the results and analyze the factors that contribute to survival predictions.

# Conclusion:
Summarize the findings and insights gained from the analysis.
Discuss the model's performance and potential areas for improvement.

# Tools and Technologies:
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms

# Deliverables:
Jupyter notebook or Python script with the code implementation.
Visualizations to support the analysis.
A comprehensive report documenting the methodology, results, and conclusions.
This reframing will guide you in building a classification model for predicting Titanic survival rates. Adjust the details based on your preferences and dataset specifics.
